DOMAIN: JAVA PROGRAMMING

DURATION: 6 WEEKS

MENTOR:NEELA SANTHOSH KUMAR

DESCRIPTION : For Task-3 of the CODTECH internship, I was assigned to create a multithreaded chat application using Java Sockets and Multithreading. The objective was to design a client-server architecture in which multiple clients could connect and communicate with each other in real time. This required an understanding of Java networking, socket programming, and concurrent execution using threads.

To build this project, a combination of open-source platforms, documentation, and programming tools was used. Below is a comprehensive explanation of how the task was accomplished and what resources supported its completion.

ðŸ›  Tools and IDE

To develop and test the Java programs, I used BlueJ, an educational Java development environment (IDE) that is ideal for object-oriented programming. BlueJâ€™s simple interface and support for terminal windows made it easy to compile, run, and observe the communication between the server and multiple clients. Each class in BlueJ was created separately: Server.java, Client.java, and supporting threads for reading and writing messages. The visual layout also helped in debugging and real-time observation of sockets being established.

ðŸ’» Programming Languages and APIs

The core programming language used was Java, specifically the Java SE (Standard Edition) platform. The following standard Java libraries were used:

java.net.ServerSocket and java.net.Socket: To establish network communication between the server and clients.

java.io.BufferedReader, java.io.InputStreamReader, java.io.PrintWriter: For reading input and writing messages between server and clients.

java.lang.Thread: To allow multiple clients to be handled simultaneously using multithreading.

These libraries are built into the Java Development Kit (JDK) and are freely available to all developers.
